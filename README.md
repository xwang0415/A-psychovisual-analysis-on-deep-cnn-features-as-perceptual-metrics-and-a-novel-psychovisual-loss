# A-psychovisual-analysis-on-deep-cnn-features-as-perceptual-metrics-and-a-novel-psychovisual-loss
The MATLAB implementations for the VFSS, weights and spatial frequency vs mean avtivation for the paper 'A psychovisual analysis on deep CNN features for perceptual metrics and a novel psychovisual loss' have been prvided. 
The main.m file is a test file on how to use the code. 
The weights can be saved in a .mat file and transferred to pytorch or tensorflow to be used to modify the VGG perceptual loss and use it for required applications.
